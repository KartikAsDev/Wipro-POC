This is for Wipro

To run the app, first install node modules, though I have already pushed the modules for the same, still if you miss any packages, please feel free to install. By running
npm install


Once you are done, please run the `npm start` to the run app.

Make Sure your default browser is the latest one. Make Chrome as the default broswer because the app open in default browser automatically. 

It will run on your localhost:3000, make sure this port is free before running the app.
